## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. **Tactical Tech-Stack**
- **Obsidian HUD**: Deep black (`#050505`) interface with a fixed **Cyber-Grid** and animated **Scanline** overlay.
- **Sci-Fi Typography**: Uses `Rajdhani` (Headers) and `JetBrains Mono` (Data) for a true command-line aesthetic.
- **Visual Intelligence**: **Slanted/Hexagonal** containers with glowing Neon Cyan borders (`#00E5FF`) and pulsing "Live Signal" indicators.

### 2. **Intelligence Layer (Detection Engine)**
- **Weighted Risk Scoring**: Precision analysis using a 40/20/10 point system.
    - **High Risk (40pts)**: Punycode/Homoglyphs (`xn--`), Direct IP connection, Urgency Keywords.
    - **Medium Risk (20pts)**: Open Redirects (`url=`, `next=`), Generic Greetings.
    - **Low Risk (10pts)**: Unsecured HTTP, excessive subdomains.
- **Advanced Heuristics**: Detects **Visual Homoglyphs** (spoofing `apple.com` with Cyrillic characters) and **Open Redirect** vulnerabilities.

### 3. **Operator Progression (Gamification)**
- **XP System**: Earn XP for every URL scanned, email analyzed, or quiz completed.
- **Rank Promotion**: 
    - `0 - 100 XP`: **JUNIOR ANALYST** (Green)
    - `101 - 500 XP`: **SENIOR FORENSIC LEAD** (Cyan)
    - `501+ XP`: **ELITE DEFENDER** (Magenta)
